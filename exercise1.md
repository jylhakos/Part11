Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily which is leading to multiple integrations per day or month. 

Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

With the continuous method of software development, you continuously build, test, and deploy iterative code changes.

A part of continuous integration is automating that process.

Continuous Integration process is a process in which software is developed by multiple sources and is automatically integrated via an established procedure.

If you are collaborating with others on a single code base, itâ€™s typical to have a shared repository of source code. 

Every developer working on the project creates a local copy and makes changes. 

Teams typically use an external service to host their source code and handle all the moving parts. 

If you want to add or modify code, you should create a copy of the main branch and work in your new, development branch. 

After every integration, you need to build the source code.

When you break the build, it means you introduced a change that rendered the final product unusable. 

When you break the build, the top priority is fixing it so everyone can resume work.

Continuous Deployment process is a process that usually follows the merge process.

The result is systematically tested to ensure your changes did not introduce errors.
